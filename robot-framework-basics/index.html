<h2>What is Robot Framework?</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://robotframework.org">Robot Framework</a> is a generic open
  source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test
  driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA).
  It has a simple plain text syntax that is easy to learn also for
  non-programmers. Its capabilities can be extended with libraries
  implemented natively using Python or Java and with other languages
  via a remote interface.
</p>
<p>
Robot Framework has a rich ecosystem around it. There are, for example,
ready-made libraries for web testing, REST APIs, Windows GUIs, databases,
SSH, Swing, and even mainframes. There are also plugins for text editors
and IDEs as well as for continuous integration and build tools like
Jenkins and Maven.
</p>

<h2>Target</h2>
<p>
The target of this training course is to learn basics of Robot Framework.
This includes creating test cases and new domain specific higher level
keywords, running tests and analyzing results, as well as understanding
the overall architecture of the framework and what is available in the
wider Robot Framework ecosystem.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
This training is especially targeted for testers, programmers, and
other development team members, but it is suitable for everyone who is
interested in Robot Framework. Participants should have at least some
testing experience, but no programming skills or previous test
automation experience is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
The training is fully generic and suitable for people in any domain.
The application under test in the hands-on exercises is web based, and
participants will thus get some web test automation skills as a bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
If there are people who are interested in Robot Framework but do not
need hands-on experience, it is possible to start with 1-2 hour
introduction and demo session where also they can participate.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Number of Participants</h2>
<p>
Preferably max 15 in the hands-on part. Bigger number is possible but
may require special arrangements.
</p>
    <p>
Possible introduction and demo session in the beginning has no
participant limits.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Course Length</h2>
<p>
Recommended length for the training is two days. One day is possible,
especially if participants have strong test automation background, but
it requires dropping some content from the agenda presented below.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Participants should have a laptop with Python installed. Python 3.6
or newer is recommended but Python 2.7 works as well. Operating system
does not matter, but participants should be comfortable using the
machine and have local admin rights to it.
</p>
    <p>
Robot Framework installation can be done either beforehand or as part
of the training. In the former case installation instructions will be
provided separately.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is possible to work also in pairs using only one laptop per pair.
    </p>
