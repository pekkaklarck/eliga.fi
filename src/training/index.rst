Training Courses
================

I organize different kind of Robot Framework related training courses.and
the most popular ones are listed below. I run both public courses and
private courses for individual client companies. Especially in the latter case
curses can be fine-tuned as needed, and totally custom courses can be
organized as well. Click on the course title for more details.

`Robot Framework introduction <robot-framework-introduction.rst>`_
    Presentation introducing Robot Framework. Typically one hour, but
    be made shorted or longer depending on needs and what is covered.
    Works also as a conference presentation.

`Robot Framework basics <robot-framework-basics.rst>`_
    Two day hands-on training for everyone interested to learn basics of
    Robot Framework. No previous Robot Framework, automation, or programming
    knowledge is needed. If participants already have automation experience,
    can be shortened to one day. This is the most popular training course.

`Robot Framework advanced <robot-framework-advanced.rst>`_
    Hands-on training continuing where the basics training ends. Topics are
    related to creating Robot Framework data, so no programming experience is
    required. When organized as a private course, should be fine-tuned
    depending on concrete needs beforehand. One or two days, depending on
    what is covered.

`Creating libraries <creating-libraries.rst>`_
    Training for those interested to learn creating libraries for Robot
    Framework using Python_ programming language. Python experience and
    at least some Robot Framework knowledge is needed. Basics can be covered
    in one day, but going to more advanced topics requires two days.
    Another very popular training course.

`Extending Robot Framework <extending-robot-framework.rst>`_
    This training course covers extending Robot Framework other ways than
    creating libraries. Python_ experience is required. Advanced course.

`Introduction to Python programming <introduction-to-python-programming.rst>`_
    Training for those wanting to learn Python_. Mostly targeted for Robot
    Framework interested to create libraries or extend the framework otherwise.
