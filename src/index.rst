Hello, world!
=============

I am Pekka Kl√§rck, the original author and lead developer of `Robot Framework`_,
a popular open source automation framework. The framework is fully generic and
it can be used for test automation, behavior driven development (BDD), and
robotic process automation (RPA).

I work as an independent consultant. Thanks to `Robot Framework Foundation`_
I can keep developing Robot Framework further, but I also provide `training
courses`_ and `other services`_ related to the framework. Please contact_ me
directly if you are interested!
